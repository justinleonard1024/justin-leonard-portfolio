This project was made as a test for "Custom Game Show", which is another project in this portfolio.
The original idea came from playing a trivia game with my friends, and I wanted a custom version for ourselves.
I made "Custom Jeopardy" as a simple proof of concept, then "Custom Game Show" as an updated version.

The game has 63 questions. There are 7 categories with 9 questions per category.
When a question button is pressed, a message box will display the question text.
After the question message box is clicked, a message box will display the answer.
The game ends when all questions have been selected.
The player with the highest recorded score wins.
