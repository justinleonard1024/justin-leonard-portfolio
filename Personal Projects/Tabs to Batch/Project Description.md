**Information:** <br />
This project is an extension for Google Chrome that I created. <br />
It allows the user to save their currently opened tabs to a batch file to be opened at any time. <br />
I created this to save multiple configurations of tabs for different purposes that I could switch between them seamlessly. <br />

You simply press the "Save Batch File" button and the current window's tabs will be saved to a batch file to launch Chrome. <br />
If the "Open Tabs in New Window" checkbox is checked, the tabs will be opened in a new window. <br />
If the "Open Incognito Window" checkbox is checked, the tabs will be opened in incognito mode.
