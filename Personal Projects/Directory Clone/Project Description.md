# Project Description
**Project Name:** Directory Clone <br />
**Programming Language:** Python <br />
**Entry Point:** DirectoryClone.py <br />

**Assets Location:** <br />
Not Applicable

**Information:** <br />
This project was made when I was transferring numerous files between a couple of drives.
I had thousands of files I wanted to transfer, but I only wanted specific files and specific types.
In addition, for some directories, I wanted to record the file and folder structure as well as the file information, but not the file contents.

This application will copy the source directory and all subdirectories to the target directory based on the specifications.
There are different modes the application can run in. The mode will determine the copy settings.
The modes are normal, blank, ignore, and used.

If the program mode is normal, all files will be copied normally. The source and target will be identical. <br />
If the program mode is blank, all files will be copied with blank versions of the originals. The contents are replaced with the file information. <br />
If the program mode is ignore, all files that don't have the ignored extensions will be blank copied and the rest normal copied. <br />
If the program mode is used, all files that only have the extensions will be normal copied.

This allows for much more versatile and quicker file transfer.
Instead of going into every single directory and selecting the files manually, I can specify what extensions to use or ignore.
Additionally, I can keep the original file structure and names for reference while having the content be the file information.
The blank copies allow for a smaller size while keeping the information.
