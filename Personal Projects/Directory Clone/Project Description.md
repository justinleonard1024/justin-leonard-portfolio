# Project Description
**Project Name:** Directory Clone <br />
**Programming Language:** Python <br />
**Entry Point:** DirectoryClone.py <br />

**Assets Location:** <br />
Not Applicable <br />

**Information:** <br />
This project was made when I was transferring numerous files between a couple of drives. <br />
I had thousands of files I wanted to transfer, but I only wanted specific files and specific types. <br />
In addition, for some directories, I wanted to record the file and folder structure as well as the file information, but not the file contents. <br />

This application will copy the source directory and all subdirectories to the target directory based on the specifications. <br />
There are different modes the application can run in. The mode will determine the copy settings. <br />
The modes are normal, blank, ignore, and used. <br />

If the program mode is normal, all files will be copied normally. The source and target will be identical. <br />
If the program mode is blank, all files will be copied with blank versions of the originals. The contents are replaced with the file information. <br />
If the program mode is ignore, all files that don't have the ignored extensions will be blank copied and the rest normal copied. <br />
If the program mode is used, all files that only have the extensions will be normal copied. <br />

This allows for much more versatile and quicker file transfer. <br />
Instead of going into every single directory and selecting the files manually, I can specify what extensions to use or ignore. <br />
Additionally, I can keep the original file structure and names for reference while having the content be the file information. <br />
The blank copies allow for a smaller size while keeping the information.
