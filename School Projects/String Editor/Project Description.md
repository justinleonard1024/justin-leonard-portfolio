The objective of this project was to create a text based menu to perform modifications to an input string.

The user will be asked to input a number based on the menu option they want.
The "Upper Case Conversion" option will convert the input text to all upper case letters.
The "Lower Case Conversion" option will convert the input text to all lower case letters.
The "Check Digits" option will check if the input string contains digits, and display if it does or does not.
The "Encryption" option will encrypt the string. The user will input an advance integer and that number will be added to each character in the string.
The "Decryption" option will decrypt the string. The user will input an advance integer and that number will be subtracted from each character in the string.
The "Exit" option will end the program.
