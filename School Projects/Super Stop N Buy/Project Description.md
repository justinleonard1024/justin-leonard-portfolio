# Project Description
**Project Name:** Super Stop N Buy <br />
**Programming Language:** C# <br />
**Entry Point:** Program.cs <br />

**Assets Location:** <br />
"Icons" and "Images" are resources <br />

**Information:** <br />
This was made in the class "Software Engineering". <br />

The objective of this project was to work as a team to create a large software project. <br />

My team decided to create a simulated shopping application for a fake store named "Super Stop N Buy" <br />
There are actually three applications used in this project. <br />
The first application is the store application for users to view and buy products. <br />
The second application is the management application for the management of the store to edit products, manage users, etc. <br />
The third application is the demo application for demonstration purposes to easily select the store or management applications. <br />

The program uses a lot of external resources such as databases for information storage, Dropbox for media, and email services for sales. <br />
The item information and user information were stored in databases. <br />
The item pictures will be stored in Dropbox. <br />
At this time, the databases and external media storage are not active due to the end of the project. <br />

The store application will allow a user to select an item from the specified category to purchase. <br />
The user will enter their payment information, delivery information, and email address. <br />
At the end of a transaction, the user will receive a confirmation email sent to them containing the sale information. <br />

The management application will allow the management team to login and control the applications. <br />
The managers can add, edit, and remove items available for purchase and item information. <br />
The managers can add, edit, and remove users from the management system.
