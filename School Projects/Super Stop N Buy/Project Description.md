The objective of this project was to work as a team to create a large software project.

My team decided to create a simulated shopping application for a fake store named "Super Stop N Buy"
There are actually three applications used in this project.
The first application is the store application. This is the actual program a user would execute to buy products.
The second application is the management application. This is the application the management of the store would use to edit products, manage users, etc.
The third application is the demo application. This is just for demonstration purposes to easily select the store application or management application.

The program uses a lot of external resources and services such as databases for information storage, Dropbox for media, and email services for sales.
The item information and user information were stored in databases.
The item pictures will be stored in Dropbox.
At this time, the databases and external media storage are not active due to the end of the project.

The store application will allow a user to select an item from the specified category to purchase.
The user will enter their payment information, delivery information, and email address.
At the end of a transaction, the user will receive a confirmation email sent to them containing the sale information.

The management application will allow the management team to login and control the applications.
The managers can add, edit, and remove items available for purchase and item information.
The managers can add, edit, and remove users from the management system.
