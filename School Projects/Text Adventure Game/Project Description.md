The objective of this project was to create a text based game.

I decided to make a game where you are trapped in a mansion with many rooms and you must find your way out.
There are many locked doors in the mansion and you have to explore rooms to get keys for specific rooms until you escape.
There is a text based display to show the visuals for the current room you are in.
You find the keys for each locked door and progress through until you find the final key and exit the mansion.

The interface will have the current floor you are on, the room you are in, and the key you have.
The user will input a letter to do a specific action.
Different actions will be available based on the room you are in.
The movement options will display the room you will enter and if it's locked.
You will be able to unlock the door to a room or floor if you currently have that room's key.

The "Front (W)" option will move forward into another room.
The "Back (S)" option will move back into another room.
The "Left (A)" option will move left into another room.
The "Right (D)" option will move right into another room.
The "Up (R)" option will move up into another floor.
The "Down (F)" option will move down into another floor.
The "Explore (E)" option will explore the current room. This will either provide flavor text or obtain a key.
The "Talk (T)" option will allow you to talk to a person in that room if available.
The "Quit (Q)" option will end the game.
