# Project Description
**Project Name:** Text Adventure Game <br />
**Programming Language:** Python <br />
**Entry Point:** Main.py <br />

**Assets Location:** <br />
Not Applicable <br />

**Information:** <br />
This was made in the class "Object Oriented Programming". <br />

The objective of this project was to create a text based game. <br />

I decided to make a game where you are trapped in a mansion with many rooms and you must find your way out. <br />
There are many locked doors in the mansion and you have to explore rooms to get keys for specific rooms until you escape. <br />
There is a text based display to show the visuals for the current room you are in. <br />
You find the keys for each locked door and progress through until you find the final key and exit the mansion. <br />

The interface will have the current floor you are on, the room you are in, and the key you have. <br />
The user will input a letter to do a specific action. <br />
Different actions will be available based on the room you are in. <br />
The movement options will display the room you will enter and if it's locked. <br />
You will be able to unlock the door to a room or floor if you currently have that room's key. <br />

The "Front (W)" option will move forward into another room. <br />
The "Back (S)" option will move back into another room. <br />
The "Left (A)" option will move left into another room. <br />
The "Right (D)" option will move right into another room. <br />
The "Up (R)" option will move up into another floor. <br />
The "Down (F)" option will move down into another floor. <br />
The "Explore (E)" option will explore the current room. This will either provide flavor text or obtain a key. <br />
The "Talk (T)" option will allow you to talk to a person in that room if available. <br />
The "Quit (Q)" option will end the game.
