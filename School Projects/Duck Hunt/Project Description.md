This was made in the class "Beginning Game Programming".

The objective of this project was to create a rudimentary game using graphics, click detection, and the Pygame Python modules.

I created a simple version of the game "Duck Hunt".
The game starts with a field and sky background.
Ducks will spawn in coming either from the left or right of the screen.
Each duck will have a random vertical height and speed.
The score will be shown at the bottom of the screen.

The cursor is the crosshair for the gun.
When the left mouse button is clicked, the gun will fire.
If the crosshair is over a duck when the mouse is clicked, the duck will die and the score will be incremented.
If the crosshair is over the trees that exist to the bottom left of the screen, a duck behind it can't be killed.
