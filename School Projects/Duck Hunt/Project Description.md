# Project Description
**Project Name:** Duck Hunt <br />
**Programming Language:** Python <br />
**Entry Point:** DuckHunt.py <br />

**Assets Location:** <br />
"Materials" and "Sounds" go in the same folder as the application <br />

**Information:** <br />
This was made in the class "Beginning Game Programming". <br />

The objective of this project was to create a rudimentary game using graphics, click detection, and the Pygame Python modules. <br />

I created a simple version of the game "Duck Hunt". <br />
The game starts with a field and sky background. <br />
Ducks will spawn in coming either from the left or right of the screen. <br />
Each duck will have a random vertical height and speed. <br />
The score will be shown at the bottom of the screen. <br />

The cursor is the crosshair for the gun. <br />
When the left mouse button is clicked, the gun will fire. <br />
If the crosshair is over a duck when the mouse is clicked, the duck will die and the score will be incremented. <br />
If the crosshair is over the trees that exist to the bottom left of the screen, a duck behind it can't be killed.
