The objective of this project was to create a large, fully featured game using graphics, game design techniques, and the Pygame Python modules.

This project is a multiplayer game of pong.
It works by having a paddle on the left and a paddle on the right.
Player 1 controls the blue paddle on the left.
Player 2 controls the red paddle on the right.
There is a ball that spawns in the middle that players have to hit into the goals.
The goals are marked on either side of the screen.

The "w" key moves Player 1 up and the "s" key moves Player 1 down.
The "up" key moves Player 2 up and the "down" key moves Player 2 down.
The "`" key pauses the game.

A ball is created, and each player must hit the ball back and forth.
Once the ball goes into the opposing player's goal, they earn a point.
The player who gets the maximum amount of points wins the game.

When either player needs one point to win, the game goes into the final mode.
In this mode, the ball speeds up every time it is hit.
It stays in this mode until a player wins.

The play button on the main menu starts the game.
Before the game starts, you can edit the max rounds, ball speed, and ball size.

The options button lets you edit game settings.
You can edit the screen size, sound effects toggle, and music toggle.

The quit button exits the game.
