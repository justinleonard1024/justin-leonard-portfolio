# Project Description
**Project Name:** Unreal Ping Pong <br />
**Programming Language:** Python <br />
**Entry Point:** game.py <br />

**Assets Location:** <br />
"Materials" and "Sounds" go in the same folder as the application <br />

**Information:** <br />
This was made in the class "Beginning Game Programming". <br />

The objective of this project was to create a fully featured game using graphics, game design techniques, and the Pygame Python modules. <br />

This project is a multiplayer game of pong. <br />
It works by having a paddle on the left and a paddle on the right. <br />
Player 1 controls the blue paddle on the left. <br />
Player 2 controls the red paddle on the right. <br />
There is a ball that spawns in the middle that players have to hit into the goals. <br />
The goals are marked on either side of the screen. <br />

The "w" key moves Player 1 up and the "s" key moves Player 1 down. <br />
The "up" key moves Player 2 up and the "down" key moves Player 2 down. <br />
The "\`" key pauses the game. <br />

A ball is created, and each player must hit the ball back and forth. <br />
Once the ball goes into the opposing player's goal, they earn a point. <br />
The player who gets the maximum amount of points wins the game. <br />

When either player needs one point to win, the game goes into the final mode. <br />
In this mode, the ball speeds up every time it is hit. <br />
It stays in this mode until a player wins. <br />

The play button on the main menu starts the game. <br />
Before the game starts, you can edit the max rounds, ball speed, and ball size. <br />

The options button lets you edit game settings. <br />
You can edit the screen size, sound effects toggle, and music toggle. <br />

The quit button exits the game.
